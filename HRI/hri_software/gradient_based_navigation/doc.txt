ROS package for robot navigation.
The input of "emergencyStop" node is the desired velocity command, the output is the velocity computed according to the data coming from a laser sensor acquired by the robot.
It can be used as obstacle avoidance system.

============================================

The "emergencyStop_with_attraction" node is the extension of the "emergencyStop" that takes into account also attractive force fields.
The attractive force field is computed from sets of attractive points.
Each attractive point is defined with its 'x' and 'y' global coordinates, and the intensity of attraction.
The set of attractive points is passed to the node through the "attractive_points" topic of type "geometry_msgs/Polygon".
Each Polygon message is essentially a vector of 3D points


"emergencyStop_with_attraction" input:
- odom frame and laser pose frame;
- desired velocity command;
- acquired laser data;
- set of attractive 3D points
	- 'x' and 'y' coordinates represent the global coordinates of the attractive points;
	- 'z' coordinate is taken to be the intensity of attraction.


"emergencyStop_with_attraction" output:
- resulting velocity command.


"emergencyStop_with_attraction" subscribed topics:
- "desired_cmd_vel": topic for desired velocity commands messages of type "geometry_msgs/Twist"
- "base_scan": topic for laser data acquisition of type "sensor_msgs/LaserScan"
- "attractive_points": topic for attractive points acquisition of type "geometry_msgs/Polygon"


"emergencyStop_with_attraction" published topics:
- "cmd_vel": topic for resulting velocity commands messages of type "geometry_msgs/Twist"


"emergencyStop_with_attraction" rosparams:
- "attractiveDistanceThreshold_m": if the distance (in meters) between the robot and an attractive point is less than this threshold, then the attraction is zero.
- "attractiveDistanceInfluence_m": this parameter represents the range of influence (in meters) of the attractive points.
- "obstaclesDistanceInfluence_m": this parameter represents the range of influence (in meters) of the repulsive obstacles computed from the laser data.
- "force_scale": scaling factor for the linear attractive/repulsive force.
- "momentum_scale": scaling factor for the attractive/repulsive momentum.
- "target_frame": laser frame id.
- "odom_frame": odom frame id.
- "GUI": boolean parameter. If true GUI is shown.


================================================

The "sendAttractivePoints" node is a simple node that publishes a set of predefined attractive points on the "attractive_points" topic.
