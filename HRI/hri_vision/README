This folder contains two demo software related to computer vision techniques for HRI.

1) bgsubtracion is a ROS node implementing a backgroud subtraction method
2) facedetect is an application implementing a face detection method.

They both use OpenCV 2.4.x (do not install OpenCV 3.0.x for these demos).

See the README files in the two folders for more details about compiling and running these modules.
