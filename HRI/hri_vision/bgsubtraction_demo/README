This is a ROS catkin node. 
Put it in a catkin workspace and compile it with catkin_make.

The demo reads images from topic /camera/rgb/image_color
and publishes a topic for activating PNP condition personAt_RoomB115
when a big enough blob is detected.

To run the demo you need a ROS node publishing an image in the
topic /camera/rgb/image_color.
Examples are: 1) a node acquiring data from a camera (e.g., Kinext, ASUS xtion, etc.)
2) a ROS bag containing this topic.

Note: If you have a node or a bag with a different topic name, this name can be remapped with the command line option <old_name>:=<new_name>
For example,

  $ rosrun bgsubtraction_demo bgsubtraction_demo_node /camera/rgb/image_color:=/my_camera/rgb/image_color
